Known as the best satire about communism, 'The Witness' has become a cult classic, which was also well received by critics and general audiences alike when it was finally released outside of Hungary. Its candid and realistic portrayal of the incompetent communist regime has earned great acclaim for both the director and the film itself when it was shown at Cannes Film Festival in 1981. 'The Witness' takes place during the height of the R\u00e1kosi Era, which was closely modeled after the ruthless and brutal Stalin regime. The film follows the life of an ordinary dike keeper, J\u00f3zsef Pelik\u00e1n, who has been caught for illegally slaughtering his pig, Dezs\u00f5. Instead of doing hard time for his \"heinous\" crime, Pelik\u00e1n is elevated into an important position, generally reserved for the communist elite. Of course, Pelik\u00e1n is utterly clueless about his newfound luck, not to mention his new job. Even his new benefactor, the mysterious Comrade Vir\u00e1g, is reluctant to reveal the real reason behind Pelik\u00e1n's preferential treatment. Thus, begins Pelik\u00e1n's hilarious adventure deep within the \"sophisticated\" communist society. One failure after another the incompetent Pelik\u00e1n is elevated higher and higher on the communist echelon, all the while remaining completely clueless about his promotions.

Despite the disruption each provides in the other's life, Mame and Patrick form a loving, supportive relationship. Mame wants to provide her sense of guidance to Patrick, which means exposing him to a broad spectrum of all that life has to offer. That changes when Mr. Babcock learns what is going on, and the stock market crashes resulting in Mame losing all her money, the events in combination leading to Mr. Babcock taking Patrick away to enroll him in boarding school away from Mame's daily influence. Although not for herself, Mame realizes that she needs money to get Patrick back and support who she considers her entire family, which includes Agnes and her faithful butler, Ito. She may get a little help in the matter from her best friend, Broadway actress Vera Charles, and a southerner she meets named Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside. Over the next several years, Mame's influence on those around her, including Patrick, is presented, although those relationships are not always smooth sailing, especially as Patrick grows into a man with a mind of his own."}, {"id": "0071807", "plot": "James Bond is targeted by the world's most expensive assassin, while he attempts to recover sensitive solar cell technology that is being sold to the highest bidder."}, {"id": "0071824", "plot": "Seattle cop is caught up in a corrupt police force that he is trying to make right.

Just like the animals and trees around them, they have the knowledge of their temporary existence, hence a sober resignation prevails. They live according to the rhythm of the earth, air and water, day and night and seasons. The daily time is divided into five parts by the sound of the call to prayer. Every day, all human events are lived through within these five time slices. In child raising, grownups go on with the practice they have experienced by their parents. They expose their love awkwardly and consider beating a favorable method. Fathers always prefer one of their sons. Mothers command their daughters ruthlessly. \u00d6mer, Yakup and Yildiz, three children of about 12,13 years old, just between childhood and youth, are the prominent characters in this movie of five times. \u00d6mer, the son of the imam, wishes hopelessly for the death of his father.

In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon study to the New York Times that showed how five Presidents consistently lied to the American people about the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing America apart. President Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg \"the most dangerous man in America,\" who \"had to be stopped at all costs.\" But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which exposed the secret deeds of an \"Imperial Presidency,\" inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of its leaders. \"The Most Dangerous Man in America\" tells the inside story, for the first time on film, of this pivotal event that changed history and transformed our nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the journalists who both covered the story and were an integral part of it; and finally-through White House audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of advisors."}, {"id": "1319727", "plot": "The biography of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, who not only grew himself up from a poor lonely child to a country's most loved person, but also rose a new country from the ashes of an empire.
