The area upon which she develops a preoccupation is her less than successful search for a husband, partly due to the imminent wedding of her younger sister Daisy, and partly due to a Marie Claire magazine article she reads about the number of sex partners one has ever had and the likelihood of marriage. Ally has had nineteen sex partners, almost twice the national average. Because the article states that hitting double the average means that the likelihood of ever finding a husband is near zero, and the fact that Daisy's fianc\u00e9 Eddie is a man who Daisy broke up with once before, Ally comes to the conclusion that she doesn't want to be a statistical zero meaning that one of her exes is the man she was destined to marry. The problem she faces is that besides the one she knows she doesn't want, she has no idea where any of the other eighteen are. The one she thinks she wants is her high school sweetheart Jake Adams, who may be the most difficult to track down, and as such she tries to find the rest. Not knowing how to go about it, she enlists the help of Colin Shea, a musician who lives across the hall from her apartment as he states he comes from a family of cops, who are trained in investigation. Colin is a more extreme and open version of Ally in that he has one one-night stand after another, he not ever having the nerve to tell his sex partners after the fact that he plans never to see them again, he preferring to hide out until they leave his apartment. As such, Ally's payment to him is to allow him to hide out in her apartment any morning until his dates leave. As Colin progresses with his largely successful search for the exes with Jake indeed being the elusive one, Ally evaluates the men one by one. However, she may not come to the realization in those evaluations that she, over the course of her love life, has always tried to fit the mold of what her boyfriend at the time wanted instead of being true to herself as a person, and that the one with who she is destined to be with is the one who truly does know her and accepts her for who she is.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "title": "What's Your Number?", "votes": 68952.0, "avgRating": 6.1, "year": 2011, "productionInfo": ["United States"], "id": "0770703"}, {"plot": "Benjamin Finnegan is a deep-sea treasure hunter certain he's onto the find of the century in waters near an island close to Key West owned by a murderous rap star to whom Ben is in debt.

Rather than face judgment to determine his final resting place, Nick is recruited by Chief Mildred Proctor into the Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.). Part of the reason for he ending up in this limbo of sorts is that on Earth, he and his partner, Detective Bobby Hayes, in the process of a drug raid, found a stash of gold pieces, which they took for themselves, Nick doing it solely in the want to make a better life for his wife, Julia. The limbo is also despite Nick, before his death, feeling remorse for this action and vowing to turn in his share of the gold, in the process not turning in Bobby. The mandate of the R.I.P.D. is to go back to Earth to find and destroy deados - dead people who have been able to evade judgment and are now back in human form among the living on Earth - so that they will face that judgment, ultimately sending them \"down there\" as their final resting place. Initially, Nick, learning that he will be going back to Boston, expects that he will be able to reunite with Julia and avenge his death in this job, that is until he learns that R.I.P.D. members are given new appearances and thus new identities. Nick is partnered with Roy Pulsipher, a longtime R.I.P.D. member who was a southern US Marshal during the Civil War era in his life on Earth. Judgmental Roy, who is not told of Nick's criminal actions, hopes to be able to retire soon to go to his final resting place. In the process of their work, they will discover that the gold pieces have a higher more nefarious purpose which, if in the wrong hands, could spell the end of life on Earth as it is known. As such, Nick tries to do this work while attending to his own initial goals of avenging his death and reuniting with Julia, which may not be easy considering the role of the gold pieces and with Roy and Proctor constantly looking over his dead shoulder.", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "title": "R.I.P.D.", "votes": 111660.0, "avgRating": 5.6, "year": 2013, "productionInfo": ["United States"], "id": "0790736"}][{"plot": "An intimate and moving meditation on the late musician and artist Kurt Cobain, based on more than 25 hours of previously unheard audiotaped interviews conducted with Cobain by noted music journalist Michael Azerrad for his book \"Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana.\" In the film, Kurt Cobain recounts his own life - from his childhood and adolescence to his days of musical discovery and later dealings with explosive fame - and offers often piercing insights into his life, music, and times.

Although not stating it as one of those failings, he also speaks about the sexual abuse of minors, both girls and boys, in his role as a priest, where his victims number in the hundreds covering approximately two decades in Central California, with his youngest known victim being nine months old. He admits that he spent as much time planning his abuses, which included gaining the confidences of parents sometimes also in sexual means, than he did with actual ministering. A handful of his victims and their support networks speak of how the abuse was able to happen, how it has negatively affected their collective lives to this day (while Father Ollie walks seemingly happy a free man in his native Ireland), and how they are trying to regain their faith in a holistic manner. Experts talk about how items specific to the Catholic religious structure institutionalize such abuse where power rests in the hands of a small few, while the flock - the masses - are meant, as good Catholics, to be subservient to that power, and why the abuse of girls is treated differently by the church than that of boys. This documentary then opens up the discussion to the fact that clergy abuse within the Catholic church is not isolated only to Father Ollie, but is widespread, may be institutionalized psychologically, and efforts are still made at almost every step by those in positions of power, including the Pope, to protect the abusers at the expense of the victims. In Father Ollie's case, he was moved from parish to parish within his diocese (the Los Angeles Diocese) and often promoted, while his victims were told he would be moved not only into therapy but into positions where children could no longer be abused.", "genres": ["Crime", "Documentary"], "title": "Deliver Us from Evil", "votes": 9466.0, "avgRating": 7.9, "year": 2006, "productionInfo": ["United States"], "id": "0814075"}, {"plot": "Jerry Ferro's 39th birthday has brought his life into sharp relief and it's not a pretty picture.

The man owns a pistol with two bullets remaining, which he will use for murder/suicide of him and his son if he feels that that is a better fate for them than life in the alternative. Food and fuel are for what everyone is looking. The man has taught his son to be suspect of everyone that they may meet, these strangers who, out of desperation, may not only try to steal what they have managed to scavenge for their own survival, but may kill them as food. Although life with his father in this world is all the boy has known, he may come to his own thoughts as to what it means holistically to be one of the good or one of the bad. Meanwhile, the man occasionally has thoughts to happier times with his wife/the boy's mother before the apocalypse, as well as not as happy times with her after the apocalypse and the reason she is no longer with them.", "genres": ["Drama"], "title": "The Road", "votes": 211093.0, "avgRating": 7.2, "year": 2009, "productionInfo": ["United States"], "id": "0898367"}, {"plot": "Burke is a motivational speaker whose book about dealing with grief is a best seller.

The CIA interrogator deems Orlov a crackpot until he names the agent tasked with killing the Russian president: Evelyn Salt. The importance of this last piece of information is that Evelyn Salt is the CIA operative currently in the room with him as his CIA interrogator, her name which he does and should not know in the current context. Darryl Peabody with CIA counter-intelligence, who is monitoring the interrogation, feels he needs to question Evelyn before she leaves the building as a matter of proper protocol. Evelyn, denying all accusations, decides instead to make a run for it, she states all in an effort to save her husband, German arachnologist Mike Krause, who she believes has been targeted as part of the Russian plot against her. Beyond love, her devotion to Mike is largely because he, before knowing of her work as a CIA agent, helped negotiate her release from North Korean captivity two years earlier when she was in special ops in the field, that captivity which included torture. The longer Evelyn is on the run, the more she looks guilty to the American authorities pursuing her. Although helping Peabody and his team try to capture Evelyn, Ted Winter, her CIA colleague, is the only person seemingly who believes she is innocent of the accusations.

The musical tastes of the chorus members generally leans toward the classical, but they love the energy of the group and reception they get from performing these more modern songs.

He generally knows what the group will and will not like at the beginning of the rehearsal period, but hopes all the songs will be favorites by the time they are perfected. Perfecting the songs and their resulting inclusion in the show are not a guarantee, as some of the individual songs do not progress well. For this concert, Bob is hoping that two former chorus members will return to do a duet, they who originally left the group due to health reasons. But as Stephen follows the chorus, including to a local prison where they will test their \"Alive and Well\" program, he learns that health is a built-in concern of the group due to their age. He also learns that singing, music and being part of this group can be a miraculous panacea to these health concerns.
