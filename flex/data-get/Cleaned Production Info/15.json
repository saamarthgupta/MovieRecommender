A young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) and her husband Fritz Altmann (Max Irons) were able to escape from what was the total Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Austria during the war eventually to live in Los Angeles. Maria has been unable to reconcile what happened during the war with being a native Austrian, contempt what she feels for Austria and the Austrian peoples. Maria hired young and relatively inexperienced Randy, the grandson of composer Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, and the son of a family friend, following the death of her older sister Luise, and discovering amongst her possessions that she was planning on taking some form of legal action with the recently instituted Restitution Committee in Austria. Only now getting back on track with his career after some earlier missteps, Randy takes the case solely for the potential financial gain in light of \"Woman in Gold\"'s market value. Even then, Randy has to convince his new bosses to allow him to work on this case, which may eventually have high profile, but little chance of success. In Vienna, Maria and Randy find an ally in Viennese investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Br\u00fchl), who tells them that the Committee is largely a sham that makes the conditions so prohibitively stringent as for no one being able to succeed. They will also find that the Austrian government generally and the administrators of the Belvedere have no intention of giving up, especially the Klimts, without a fight. Beyond these obstacles, Maria and Randy also have to discover if they do have a legal foot on which to stand regarding whether the paintings rightfully belong to Maria. As Maria and Randy hit one roadblock after another, Randy gains a new appreciation for the case in his affection for Maria and in coming to terms as being a descendant of Holocaust survivors. In Randy discovering alternative legal channels in which to pursue as those at the Belvedere refuse to negotiate, they all know that the Belvedere has one other important factor on their side: that they can drag out whatever legal proceedings as long as need be for elderly Maria to die before any legal decision is made.", "genres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "title": "Woman in Gold", "votes": 49623.0, "avgRating": 7.3, "year": 2015, "productionInfo": ["United Kingdom"], "id": "2404425"}, {"plot": "The residents of a small town are being pressured by a man, Bartholomew Bogue to sell him their land for a paltry price.

Evan has wanted to ask his senior associate Elizabeth out for over a year, but has resisted in not wanting to dip into the company well. And Jason is the big kid, which has led to a life of irresponsibility and bad judgment. Although Evan thinks it, Jason, from what Nardo says at the end of his bachelor party, acts upon his belief that Nardo doesn't really want to marry Tracy. Jason's action and Evan's non-reaction leads not only to Jason and Tracy breaking up at the altar, but Nardo breaking ties with both his friends. While Tracy has gone on her and Nardo's Mexican resort honeymoon on her own, Nardo has gone down to chase after and make it up to her in hopes of reconciling. In the process, Nardo gets stranded somewhere unknown in Mexico with literally nothing. As such, Jason drags Evan down to Mexico to rescue their friend wherever he may be.
