In the scenic beachside state of Goa, Frieda (Sarah Jane Dias), a strong-willed and celebrated photographer, gathers her closest friends on the eve of her nuptials. The diverse (and often hilarious) group is a snapshot of modern Indian society: Su (Sandhya Mridul), a businesswoman and mother; the engaging Nargis (Tannishtha Chatterjee, who also appears at this year's Festival in Parched); Jo (Amrit Maghera), an aspiring Bollywood actress; Pammy (Pavleen Gujral), a housewife; Mad (Anushka Manchanda), a singer-songwriter; and the house servant, Lakshmi (Rajshri Deshpande). Everything's set for a night of celebration. There's only one issue: Frieda won't say who her betrothed is. As they banter their way through a tonally varied series of scenes - some of them jubilantly comic, others loaded with pathos - the characters in Angry Indian Goddesses evolve far beyond mere tropes. Their conversation, derived entirely from improvisations among the actors, covers everything from sex to street harassment to the buff (and often shirtless) next-door neighbour. As the night goes on, we become acquainted with the women's dreams, desires, fears, and above all, their unwavering bond with one another - a bond that eventually takes them to extreme lengths. The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder sparked discussions about women's rights in India that are still ongoing. An important new cinematic entry in the conversation, Angry Indian Goddesses is a refreshing and frank depiction of female empowerment from a key figure in independent South Asian cinema.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "title": "Angry Indian Goddesses", "votes": 2483.0, "avgRating": 7.1, "year": 2015, "productionInfo": ["India", "Germany"], "id": "3368222"}, {"plot": "When Justin's older brother, Kyle, is killed in Afghanistan, Justin can't believe that his brother is really gone.

Bing operated without a Major League affiliation while playing in a city that was considered a wasteland for professional baseball. Tryouts for the Mavericks, which were open to the public, were filled with hopefuls who arrived in droves from every state in America, many of whom had been rejected by organized baseball. Skeptics agreed it would never work.

The Battered Bastards of Baseball is as much about the independent spirit as it is about baseball.

Timothy was poisoned on Halloween by a real life monster who used the legend to hide his crime, earning him the nickname, The Candyman.

While the babysitter has become the go-to victim in so many of our horror films, does the same hold true in real life? Tragically, the answer is yes - as our filmmakers discover in the unsolved murder of Janett Christman - a babysitter who was slain in Columbia, MO, in 1950.

Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant.
