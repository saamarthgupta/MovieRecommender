However, Communism, in the late 1940s following World War II, is now seen as being a plague to American democracy with the on-set of the Cold War, with Communists automatically viewed as working for the Soviets. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) focused much of its attention toward flushing out Communists within the Hollywood movie industry as being high profile, celebrated author and Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston), who has often spoken on the rights of workers, especially within the industry, being one of the primary targets as being a known card-carrying Communist. Dalton, and who would be coined the \"Hollywood 10\", have their own tactics, not only dealing with the subpoenas to appear before the HUAC where they are to admit being card-carrying Communists, and to name names of others of who the HUAC may not be aware, but in how they can avoid answering the questions and not be charged with contempt and subsequently imprisoned, all in protection of their First Amendment rights. Their tactics are against the high powered assistance of some in the Hollywood community, arguably most powerfully anti-Communist gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Dame Helen Mirren), who mobilizes the public through her column. The Hollywood 10 plan does not quite work out the way they had mapped it, which includes being blacklisted to prevent working for any American movie studio, effectively ruining their livelihoods.

Those crimes included gambling, drug dealing, loan sharking, extortion and murder. His victims and family and friends of his victims are relieved that his reign of terror is over. However, there is heavy speculation that many on both sides of the law are not as happy about Bulger going to trial for fear of probable testimony, including the hint that he acted for many years as an FBI informant, which if true Bulger himself would not want known as he considers snitches to be the lowest of the low. Also if true, the FBI would not want the public to know, especially if that informant status provided Bulger FBI protection in return. As the trial proceeds, the nature of the implication is that there are more agencies involved in a conspiracy to protect Bulger for \"bigger\" purposes. Regardless of if Bulger was indeed an informant, that conspiracy would have directly led to some of those murders purportedly committed by Bulger and led to Bulger being tipped by the FBI as to his potential capture that sixteen years earlier.

Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant.

Long divorced fifty-five year old chain smoker Dorothea Fields, a product of wanting to work during the war years, is an independently and liberally minded draftsperson. She has not had a steady man in her life since the divorce. Despite having a plethora of other people in their lives as Dorothea's answer to almost every situation is to invite people over for dinner, she and her fifteen year old son, Jamie Fields, are the only other biological family each has per se in a meaningful way. Dorothea wants to give Jamie as much freedom and responsibility as possible to make informed decisions and mistakes from which to learn. As Jamie is at the age of transitioning into a grown-up and as she doesn't recognize her son anymore as he is a teen of his day (the punk music about which she is truly mystified), Dorothea is still concerned, without that male influence, that he won't turn into the adult she would want. As Jamie and their male boarder William, an Earth child who is tasked with doing the renovations on their house, haven't really bonded in that buddy/buddy or father figure way, Dorothea turns to two other women in their lives to help her provide guidance to Jamie through this transition period. One is their other boarder, twenty-four year old Abbie Porter, an aspiring photographer, who is an inherently sad woman out of her own life confusion, and an avowed feminist. Two is Jamie's best friend since childhood, seventeen year old Julie Hamlin, who he's loved all his life and with who he has wanted to have sex ever since he hit puberty.

This situation with this collective is as much about each person's development at this phase in their life with these other people as it is about Jamie becoming a responsible male adult, especially as he too is concerned about his mother, who, despite her independence, he feels has not moved on since the divorce."}]
