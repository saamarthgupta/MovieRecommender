The area upon which she develops a preoccupation is her less than successful search for a husband, partly due to the imminent wedding of her younger sister Daisy, and partly due to a Marie Claire magazine article she reads about the number of sex partners one has ever had and the likelihood of marriage. Ally has had nineteen sex partners, almost twice the national average. Because the article states that hitting double the average means that the likelihood of ever finding a husband is near zero, and the fact that Daisy's fianc\u00e9 Eddie is a man who Daisy broke up with once before, Ally comes to the conclusion that she doesn't want to be a statistical zero meaning that one of her exes is the man she was destined to marry. The problem she faces is that besides the one she knows she doesn't want, she has no idea where any of the other eighteen are. The one she thinks she wants is her high school sweetheart Jake Adams, who may be the most difficult to track down, and as such she tries to find the rest. Not knowing how to go about it, she enlists the help of Colin Shea, a musician who lives across the hall from her apartment as he states he comes from a family of cops, who are trained in investigation. Colin is a more extreme and open version of Ally in that he has one one-night stand after another, he not ever having the nerve to tell his sex partners after the fact that he plans never to see them again, he preferring to hide out until they leave his apartment. As such, Ally's payment to him is to allow him to hide out in her apartment any morning until his dates leave. As Colin progresses with his largely successful search for the exes with Jake indeed being the elusive one, Ally evaluates the men one by one. However, she may not come to the realization in those evaluations that she, over the course of her love life, has always tried to fit the mold of what her boyfriend at the time wanted instead of being true to herself as a person, and that the one with who she is destined to be with is the one who truly does know her and accepts her for who she is."}, {"id": "0770752", "plot": "Benjamin Finnegan is a deep-sea treasure hunter certain he's onto the find of the century in waters near an island close to Key West owned by a murderous rap star to whom Ben is in debt.

Rather than face judgment to determine his final resting place, Nick is recruited by Chief Mildred Proctor into the Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.). Part of the reason for he ending up in this limbo of sorts is that on Earth, he and his partner, Detective Bobby Hayes, in the process of a drug raid, found a stash of gold pieces, which they took for themselves, Nick doing it solely in the want to make a better life for his wife, Julia. The limbo is also despite Nick, before his death, feeling remorse for this action and vowing to turn in his share of the gold, in the process not turning in Bobby. The mandate of the R.I.P.D. is to go back to Earth to find and destroy deados - dead people who have been able to evade judgment and are now back in human form among the living on Earth - so that they will face that judgment, ultimately sending them \"down there\" as their final resting place. Initially, Nick, learning that he will be going back to Boston, expects that he will be able to reunite with Julia and avenge his death in this job, that is until he learns that R.I.P.D. members are given new appearances and thus new identities. Nick is partnered with Roy Pulsipher, a longtime R.I.P.D. member who was a southern US Marshal during the Civil War era in his life on Earth.

Although not stating it as one of those failings, he also speaks about the sexual abuse of minors, both girls and boys, in his role as a priest, where his victims number in the hundreds covering approximately two decades in Central California, with his youngest known victim being nine months old. He admits that he spent as much time planning his abuses, which included gaining the confidences of parents sometimes also in sexual means, than he did with actual ministering. A handful of his victims and their support networks speak of how the abuse was able to happen, how it has negatively affected their collective lives to this day (while Father Ollie walks seemingly happy a free man in his native Ireland), and how they are trying to regain their faith in a holistic manner. Experts talk about how items specific to the Catholic religious structure institutionalize such abuse where power rests in the hands of a small few, while the flock - the masses - are meant, as good Catholics, to be subservient to that power, and why the abuse of girls is treated differently by the church than that of boys. This documentary then opens up the discussion to the fact that clergy abuse within the Catholic church is not isolated only to Father Ollie, but is widespread, may be institutionalized psychologically, and efforts are still made at almost every step by those in positions of power, including the Pope, to protect the abusers at the expense of the victims. In Father Ollie's case, he was moved from parish to parish within his diocese (the Los Angeles Diocese) and often promoted, while his victims were told he would be moved not only into therapy but into positions where children could no longer be abused."}, {"id": "0814130", "plot": "Jerry Ferro's 39th birthday has brought his life into sharp relief and it's not a pretty picture.

Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch, or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock, Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion, intellect, and unfailing sense of humour.

Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest,' director Sophie Fiennes' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas.

Upon much coercion by Maya, Will finally relents but with one caveat and two assertions: he will change the names of the women involved so that Maya will have to figure out which is her mother, the story is not as simple as Maya would probably hope, but the story does have a happy ending. Will begins his story in 1992, when he, then politically active and fantasizing of one day becoming president, moves temporarily from his college stomping grounds of Madison, Wisconsin to New York City to work on Bill Clinton's presidential bid. The three primary candidates as Maya's mother are: \"Emily\", Will's college sweetheart, who is afraid that Will will never return from New York and if he does that his experience there will fundamentally change him; \"Summer\", Emily's New York based friend, a sexually liberated woman and professionally ambitious writer; and \"April\", the copy girl in Clinton's New York campaign office, she who challenges Will intellectually but who herself is unmotivated to do anything with her life. As Will's professional life rises and falls, and as Emily, Summer and April enter, exit and reenter his life, Maya continually changes her opinion on who she wants to be her mother. But as Will's story hits what Maya believes to be close to its conclusion (after a series of previous possible close conclusions), Maya believes she's figured out if Emily, Summer or April is indeed her mother. But Maya also learns that Will is correct in that the story is not as simple as a \"Will/Sarah\" happy ending and tries to help him find that happiness she feels he deserves."}, {"id": "0832903", "plot": "Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky posits that man made landscapes define who we are as people.

After Michael starts attending classes at Wingate, most of his teachers believe he is unteachable, except his science teacher, Mrs. Boswell, who begins to understand that he learns in a different way. Believing he is indeed homeless, Caucasian and staunch Republican Leigh Anne Tuohy - mother of Wingate students, teen Collins Tuohy and adolescent S.J. Tuohy, and wife to Sean Tuohy, franchise owner of several Taco Bell's - invites Michael to stay in the Tuohy's upscale home for the night.

Part of that emotional investment for Leigh Anne is fully understanding Michael as a person so that he can fulfill his potential as a human being, which includes giving him opportunities such as what Coach Cotton initially saw in Michael as a potential left tackle. Potential problems include Michael's poor academic standing which may prohibit him from participating in extracurricular activities at the school, his learning disability which may extend to other aspects of his life beyond his schooling, whether he actually can play football, and authorities questioning Leigh Anne and all the Tuohy's motivations in inviting Michael into their home and family."}, {"id": "0878835", "plot": "Two families, sort of neighbours in Manhattan, cross paths as they navigate marriage, parenthood of a teen, ennui, a first date, and end-of-life care.

Annabelle's paternal aunt is St. Trinian's spinster headmistress, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle does whatever she can to make her father, Carnaby Fritton, take her away to anywhere else but St. Trinian's. The new Minister of Education, Geoffrey Thwaites, who happens to be Verity's father, wants to clean up the school system by making an example of St. Trinian's. What Geoffrey does not know Miss Fritton an old flame of his, is the school's headmistress. St. Trinian's faces further problems when the bank will soon foreclose if they cannot make full payment on their \u00a3500,000 debt. This situation combined with finding out why her father sent her St. Trinian's leads to Annabelle finding her place for the first time in her life. The girls find out about the problems, and come to the realization that they would never have the same amount of freedom they have at St Trinians, at any other school and as such decide to work with Flash Harry to devise some plan to come up with the money to keep the school open. The plan will take all of their collective cunning to devise and pull off, which includes the not so easy task of making it into the finals of the national School Challenge, an academic competition between schools. They have other obstacles including Geoffrey and Verity, who continue to want to show up St. Trinian's and Annabelle respectively at any opportunity."}, {"id": "0967945", "plot": "A woman leaves an abusive relationship to begin a new life in a new city, where she forms an unlikely and ironic relationship with a suicidal hitman (unbeknownst to her).

Fashion in an off-handed manner is already present in her being, she always decrying both their costumes and the general style of the day for women, both which are in her mind overly frilly and constraining. She and Adrienne are different personalities, Adrienne who aspires to that of most young women, love and marriage to a husband that will take care of her. Coco, on the other hand, has a streak of independence, bluntly speaking her mind, stretching the truth or lying to get what she wants, and not believing in love or a man in her life. She believes security can be had by getting to Paris and performing in the famous Alcazar. En route, she begins a symbiotic relationship of sorts with \u00c9tienne Balsan, a wealthy stable owner who she met in Moulins. Through Blasan, Coco will meet two other people that play important parts in her life. One is actress Emilienne d'Alen\u00e7on, who, while still adhering to the style of the day, admires certain aspects of Coco's own individual style, especially her simple straw hats. The other is English coal magnate Arthur Capel - nicknamed Boy - who may make Coco change her mind about love."}, {"id": "1037033", "plot": "Independent filmmaker Chris Waitt attempts to interview his ex-girlfriends to find out why they dumped him.

Such is not the case with college student Ian Hamilton, a Glaswegian who, easily sidetracked from his studies much to his father's dismay, is often directed toward thoughts of Scottish nationalism. After a rally by leading nationalist John MacCormick and the latest setback in Scottish independence, Ian wants to do something if only symbolic to demonstrate that nationalism. Although many in the movement had talked about it largely in jest or having England officially return it to Scotland, what Ian decides he wants to do is steal the Stone of Scone currently on display at Westminster Abbey in London, it being housed in England that symbol of the English oppression of Scotland. After coming up with a low tech but what he thinks is an effective plan, he has to get some support. One person he wants to finance the operation is MacCormick himself, his support or not which can nonetheless only be off the record, and the request by Ian which gets a mixed reaction from MacCormick who supports the thought of the theft but sees the actual plan as a joke. He also has to amass a team to carry out the actual heist, the largest obstacle in this low tech plan arguably having sufficient people-power actually to move the heavy stone without mechanical assistance. One person he hopes will be part of the team is his best friend Bill Craig, who Ian's father always points to as the model as almost having completed his studies unlike Ian and who is on the verge of being married. The disparate group he is able to pull together have as that common factor the task at hand at almost any cost, which may only be in theory as they may not have that mentality if things start to fall apart. One other item Ian did not even consider in the plan, which may be an important factor, is what to do with the stone if they are able to steal it."}, {"id": "1037163", "plot": "An examination of the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 through to the present day."}, {"id": "1037218", "plot": "An aging Hollywood star, Joe Scott, lives a life of narcissistic hedonism, observed by his laconic personal assistant, Ophelia.
