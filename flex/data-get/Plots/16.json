Matt and Tina's marriage was not able to survive largely on Tina still blaming Matt for her disappearance. The situation was only exacerbated by Niagara Regional Police Detective Jeffrey Cornwall - just transferred from Homicide to work in the Internet Child Exploitation Unit headed by Nicole Dunlop - believing that Matt may have been involved in her disappearance, he possibly having sold her to help pay the bills. Not trusting the police after all these years, Matt has vowed to find Cass on his own, which only added to the strain between him and Tina, as Tina saw no comprehensive plan from him to achieve that goal, while Tina still keeps in touch with Nicole and Jeffrey, who have since entered into their own personal relationship. Jeffrey believes they've made a break in the case when he, now patrolling the dark web on child pornography sites, thinks he found a recent image of Cass. It indeed is her, she being held captive in a locked room by a man named Mika, his identity which Cass has never discovered even after all these years. He is a pedophile, and even though eighteen year old Cass no longer appeals to the pedophile in him, he is using her to lure other children into his midst. Through this time, Mika, with computer expertise, has been able to monitor specifically Tina's movements at work as a chambermaid at a Niagara Falls hotel.

Former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is mildly depressed for being fired from his post as a press secretary for a British government minster for information misconstrued in something he wrote, he being the token fall guy in the matter. Initially thinking about writing about his forte of Russian history, he somewhat reluctantly, as his first post-firing job, decides instead to write a probably more lucrative human interest story on Philomena Lee (Dame Judi Dench) when he learns of her plight from her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), his reluctance as he doesn't see himself as a writer of fluff. As a teenager, Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark) lived at Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, Ireland as an unwed mother, there where she and the other unwed teenaged mothers were required to live and serve the abbey as \"repayment\" for four years. They all had limited access to their children, and while many, including Philomena, wanted eventually to leave with their children, they knew the nuns could and would adopt out the children if given the opportunity. Philomena's son, Anthony (Tadhg Bowen), was adopted when he was aged three, she not even being notified or thus allowed to say goodbye to him before it happened. Although Philomena has thought about Anthony her entire life and had made attempts to find him before, she has a strong feeling of uncertainty about him now on what would have been his fiftieth birthday. She doesn't necessarily want to see him, especially if she knows he doesn't want to see her, or blame anyone, especially those at the abbey as she is still a devout Catholic, but just wants to know that he is all right. In his time with Philomena, much of it just being the two of them alone, Martin, who has generally led a life of privilege, has to overcome his derision toward her solely because of her more provincial attitude. After visiting the abbey where most of the nuns from Philomena's time there have died, Martin decides to follow an anecdotal and thus unsubstantiated lead which takes the two of them to the United States. That rift between the two of them could widen if he discovers something in the story that she doesn't really want to know, or follow-up on, which could in turn be problematic as she may or may not be aware that he contractually has a story to write, he needing to find its most newsworthy aspects, good or bad."}, {"id": "2433040", "plot": "The film follows William Reynolds, a former assassin for the British East India Company.

These interviews include with all four band members, others involved with the band at the time, and fans, including current day celebrities, in how the band affected their own lives then and now. Some information is provided in that the band was not the overnight success it is thought to be when they virtually exploded onto the worldwide consciousness in 1963. Beyond the band members themselves and their music, the input of other key players into the band's success is shown, including that of manager Brian Epstein, press agent Derek Taylor, and music producer George Martin. The effect of their movies, especially the first, A Hard Day's Night (1964), which was an extension of their on stage fun loving, slightly cheeky, quick witted and friendly personae, on their success is shown. Their lives are shown against a backdrop of global events of the time, including the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy and the onset of the Vietnam War. The reasons behind their decision to stop touring, despite it being the most lucrative aspect of their careers, to focus on studio recording in 1966 is also presented, that decision which was not all of their own doing, and which had as a factor their changing musical tastes in only being able to experiment in a studio setting partly a result of growing into full fledged adults. Their sole post-1966 public performance in this foursome in 1969 concludes the documentary."}, {"id": "2531344", "plot": "In suburban Chicago, Great Lakes High School seniors Julie, Kayla and Sam, who have been best friends since they met the first day of their school life, are preparing for prom night.

After an initial business misstep in London, Papa believes it is fate that their van breaks down just outside of the French town of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val, that they meet a local foodie, a young woman named Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon), who introduces them to the abundance of fresh locally sourced produce, seafood and meats, and that there is an abandoned restaurant property on the outskirts of town for sale. Against the wishes of the family, Papa decides to purchase the property for their business, even after learning that the previous owners could not make a go of it because it is a mere one hundred feet from Le Saule Pleureur, a Michelin-starred restaurant where Marguerite works as a sous-chef, she trying to work her way up to chef-de-cuisine. Papa's resolve is strengthened as he believes their style of food is not only different than the French, but better in their bold flavors, something he wants to show the locals. Madame Mallory (Dame Helen Mirren), Le Saule Pleureur's proprietress, took over its running following the death of her husband. The restaurant is now her entire life, and she has waited close to thirty years for it to receive its second Michelin-star, so far without success. Madame Mallory does not take too kindly to her new neighbors, not only as potential competition, but in the Kadams', most specifically Papa's, brash and forward approach to life, unlike the refined French. An initial action by Madame Mallory to make sure Maison Mumbai, the Kadams' restaurant, doesn't succeed, leads to an all out war between her and Papa. But a potential bridge emerges between the two restaurants with the budding friendship and possible romance between Hassan and Marguerite. Beyond that friendship and romance, Hassan believes, to survive, they have to meld their bold flavors to local ingredients and techniques, he who wants to learn the art of French cooking from Marguerite. A singular action in that war results in what could be a fundamental shift between all the players at Le Saule Pleureur and Maison Mumbai."}, {"id": "2980706", "plot": "In the wake of another successful racing season, Dusty returns home to Propwash Junction to resume his training.
